# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
This site showcases my professional background, projects, and publications as a software engineer passionate about building high-quality software experiences.

## About

This portfolio is a minimalist, responsive, and theme-toggleable static website built with **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** – no frameworks, no dependencies. It reflects my design and development philosophy: clean, fast, and maintainable.

Features:

- Dark/light theme toggle with local storage + system preference support
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Timeline-based CV with dynamic layout
- Projects and publications with custom card layout
- Custom social media icons (SVGs)
- No external JS libraries
